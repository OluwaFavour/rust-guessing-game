# RUST GUESSING GAME

## Description

This is a simple guessing game written in Rust. The program will generate a random number between 1 and 100 and the user will have to guess the number. The program will tell the user if the number is too high or too low. The user will have 5 tries to guess the number. If the user guesses the number correctly, the program will congratulate the user and end. If the user does not guess the number correctly after 5 tries, the program will tell the user that they have lost and end.
